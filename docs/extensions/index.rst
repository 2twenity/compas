Core Extensions
===============

The core extension packages are Python wrappers for libraries written in other languages,
or for their Python bindings,
and define many of the plugins for the pluggables of the core library.
They can of course also be used independently as normal Python packages.

.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card:: :mod:`compas_occ`

        Wrapper for the Python binding (:mod:`pythonocc`) of OpenCascade.
        Provides support for NURBS geometry and Boundary Representations (BREPs), independently of Rhino.

        `compas_occ <https://github.com/compas-dev/compas_occ>`_

    .. grid-item-card:: :mod:`compas_cgal`

        Wrapper for specific algorithms of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.
        Among other things, provides support for boolean operations on triangle meshes.
