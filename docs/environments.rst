The core functionality of **COMPAS** is completely independent of CAD tools and
can be used from the terminal, in standalone scripts, or with the plotters 
and viewers that are shipped with the main library.

In addition, **COMPAS** can be easily used in CAD software using the corresponding
CAD packages. Currently, Rhino, Blender, and Grasshopper are supported.
Since most CAD packages ship with their own version of Python which is different
from the Python on your system in which **COMPAS** is installed, you need to let
the CAD software know where **COMPAS** is before you can use it.
