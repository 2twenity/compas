What are plugins?
-----------------

COMPAS has an extensible architecture based on plugins that allows to
customize and extend the functionality of the core framework.

For a plugin to work, there needs to exist a counterpart to be connected to.
This means there are two components involved:

* :meth:`compas.plugins.pluggable` interface: the *extension point* that COMPAS defines
  as the counterpart for plugins to connect to.
* :meth:`compas.plugins.plugin` implementation: a *concrete implementation* of the
  ``pluggable`` interface.

Both of these components are declared using decorators:

.. code-block:: python

    @pluggable
    def do_hard_stuff(input):
        pass

    @plugin(pluggable_name='do_hard_stuff')
    def do_hard_stuff_numpy(input):
        # NOTE: Here use the power of numpy to do hard stuff very fast
        # ..

Once these parts are implemented, the program could simply
call the function ``do_hard_stuff`` and the appropriate plugin
implementation using ``numpy`` would be called automatically.


Why are plugins important?
--------------------------

The example above is just a single code block, but the power of plugins comes
from the ability to split those two parts -the :meth:`compas.plugins.pluggable`
and the :meth:`compas.plugins.plugin`- into completely different files, folders
or even entire projects and still work the same way.

Additionally, COMPAS is able to pick the most suitable plugin implementation
for its current execution context. For instance, one could have two implementations
of the same :meth:`compas.plugins.pluggable` definition, one using ``numpy`` and
another one using *Rhino SDK* and have the correct one automatically selected
based on where your script is executing.


How to make plugins discoverable?
---------------------------------

COMPAS plugin discovery is based on naming conventions. This is mainly due to
the need to support IronPython inside Rhino, which lacks ``setuptools``
infrastructure. For more details, check
`these python guidelines <https://packaging.python.org/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/#using-naming-convention>`_.

A COMPAS plugin needs to fulfill two conditions:

* **Name**: The package name should be prefixed with ``compas``, eg. ``compas_cgal``.
* **Metadata**: The package should define a bit of metadata listing the modules that contain plugins.
  This is done declaring a variable called ``__all_plugins__``,
  eg. ``__all_plugins__ = ['compas_cgal.booleans']``.

COMPAS automatically discovers plugins searching over all available packages in the system,
and picks up those prefixed with the ``compas`` word.
All packages are included in the search: packages installed with ``pip``, packages made
available through the ``PYTHONPATH`` / ``IRONPYTHONPATH``, local packages, etc.

Once a package is found, the metadata in ``__all_plugins__`` is read and all modules
listed are analyzed to look for functions decorated with the :meth:`compas.plugins.plugin`
decorator.


Two kinds of extension points
-----------------------------

An extension point, or *pluggable* interface can be declared as being one of two types
based on how they select which implementation to pick if there are multiple available.

* ``selector='first_match'``: this type of extension point will pick the first plugin
  implementation that satisfies the requirements.
* ``selector='collect_all'``: extension points defined with this selector will instead
  collect all plugin implementations and execute them all, collecting the return
  values into a list. An example of this is the Rhino install extension
  point: :meth:`compas_rhino.install.installable_rhino_packages`.


A complete example
------------------

Let's explore a complete example to gain a better understanding.


Extension point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the sake of example, we are going to assume that ``compas`` core defines
the following :meth:`compas.plugins.pluggable` interface in

**compas/geometry/booleans/__init__.py**

.. code-block:: python

    @pluggable(category='booleans')
    def boolean_union_mesh_mesh(A, B):
        pass


Plugin
^^^^^^

Now let's write a plugin that implements this interface:

**compas_plugin_sample/__init__.py**

.. code-block:: python

    __all_plugins__ = ['compas_plugin_sample.boolean_trimesh']


**compas_plugin_sample/boolean_trimesh.py**

.. code-block:: python

    import trimesh

    @plugin(category='booleans', requires=['trimesh'])
    def boolean_union_mesh_mesh(A, B):
        va, fa = A
        at = trimesh.Trimesh(vertices=va, faces=fa)

        vb, fb = B
        bt = trimesh.Trimesh(vertices=vb, faces=fb)

        r = at.union(bt, engine='scad')

        return r.vertices, r.faces

Voil√†! We have a trimesh-based boolean union plugin!


Advanced options
----------------

There are a few additional options that plugins can use:

* ``requires``: List of requirements. COMPAS will filter out plugins if their
  requirements list is not satisfied at runtime. This allows to have multiple implementations
  of the same operation and have them selected based on different criteria.
  The requirement can either be a package name string (e.g. ``requires=['scipy']``) or
  a ``callable`` with a boolean return value, in which any arbitrary check can be implemented
  (e.g. ``requires=[lambda: is_rhino_active()]``).
* ``tryfirst`` and ``trylast``: Plugins cannot control the exact priority they will have
  but they can indicate whether to try to prioritize them or demote them as fallback using
  these two boolean parameters.
* ``pluggable_name``: Usually, the name of the decorated plugin method matches that of the
  pluggable interface. When that is not the case, the pluggable name can be specified via
  this parameter.
* ``domain``: extension points are unambiguously identified by a URL that combines domain,
  category and pluggable name. All COMPAS core plugins use the same domain, but other
  packages could potentially decide to use a different domain to ensure collision-free
  naming of pluggable extension points.

While developing plugins, it is also possible to enable print output to understand what
how plugin selection works behind the scenes. To enable that, set ``DEBUG`` flag
accordingly:

.. code-block:: python

    from compas.plugins import plugin_manager
    plugin_manager.DEBUG = True
