.. rst-class:: lead

This is the documentation of the main library of the COMPAS framework.
The main library consists of a core package, a package for 2D visualization,
and three additional packages for the integration in CAD software.

The core package (:mod:`compas`) defines all functionality for geometry processing,
data structures, topology, numerical methods, robotics, ... and can be used
independently of CAD systems in any environment that supports Python.

The CAD packages (:mod:`compas_rhino`, :mod:`compas_ghpython`, :mod:`compas_blender`)
provide a unified framework for reading and writing CAD geometry, for visualization
of COMPAS geometry and data structures, and for basic user inter interaction
in Blender, Rhino, and Grasshopper.
