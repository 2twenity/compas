COMPAS releases are available on the Python Package Index (PyPI), on ``conda-forge``
or directly from the Github repo.

Versions are tagged following the Semantic Versioning (semver) convention of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.
For more information see `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/>`_.

The current version of COMPAS is ``0.19.1``, which means we have not yet established a compleltely stable API.
However, the ``0.19`` version series is the last before the release of ``COMPAS 1.0.0``!

In the future, in addition to a version number, major releases will also have a name following the pattern
``<geometric adjective> <nautical term>``, with the words forming an alliteration and the alliteration letter correspoding to the number of the release.
For example, the first release could be ``COMPAS 1.0.0: the Affine Admiral``.
The second could be ``COMPAS 2.0.0: the Barycentric Bulkhead``, and so on.
