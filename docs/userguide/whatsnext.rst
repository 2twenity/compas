If you have successfully installed COMPAS and managed to run the samples in :doc:`/userguide/firststeps`,
you are ready for the next challenge. Where to go from here depends on what you want to do.

.. replace by cards

* If you're still just exploring, you may want to continue with the basic geometry tutorial: :doc:`/userguide/basics.geometry`.
* If you have a specific AEC application in mind, perhaps the AEC workflows on the COMPAS website can help you get started: https://compas-dev/documentation/workflows
* If you're a developer and want to develop your own tools, or you want to contribute to COMPAS, go tod the developer guide: :doc:`/devguide/index`.

In any case, enjoy!, And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask on the forum: https://forum.compas-framework.org.
