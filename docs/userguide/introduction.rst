COMPAS is an open-source, Python-based framework for computational research and collaboration in architecture, engineering, fabrication and construction.
It offers a wide range of functionality for the analysis, planning, and simulation of complex and bespoke architectural and engineering systems.

The Framework
=============

.. The framework consists of a collection of loosely coupled Python packages that can be used alone or in combination with other packages.

The framework consists of a core library (:mod:`compas`), core extensions (:mod:`compas_cgal`, :mod:`compas_libigl`, :mod:`compas_occ`, :mod:`compas_gmsh`),
a standalone viewer (:mod:`compas_view2`),
dedicated integrations for Rhino (:mod:`compas_rhino`), Grasshopper (:mod:`compas_ghpython`), and Blender (:mod:`compas_blender`),
and a growing number of packages for specific tasks in the AEC domain, such as:

* :mod:`compas_fab` for robotic fabrication
* :mod:`compas_dem` for discrete element modelling
* :mod:`compas_fea` for finite element analysis
* :mod:`compas_fdm` for constrained form finding
* :mod:`compas_ifc` for building information modelling
* ...

This documentation is primarily about the core library, but it also contains information about the dedicated CAD integrations,
and, where relevant, the reader is referred to the documentation of core extensions and some of the AEC packages.

compas-dev
==========

The development of the core infrastructure of COMPAS is coordinated on GitHub at the ``compas-dev`` organisation.
