The compas framework is based on Python.
Python 3 is fully supported and the code is backwards compatible with Python +2.6.


Built-in types
==============

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html

* numeric types: int, float, complex
* iterator types
* sequence types: list, tuple, range
* text sequence type: str
  Textual data in Python is handled with str objects, or strings.
  Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode code points.
* binary sequence types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
* set types: set, frozenset
* mapping types: dict
  A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects.
  Mappings are mutable objects.
  There is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary.
* context manager types:
  Python's with statement supports the concept of a runtime context defined by a context manager.
* other types: modules, classes and class instances, functions, methods,
  code objects, type objects, null object, ellipsis object, notimplemented object,
  boolean values, internal objects


Container types

* list
* set
* tuple
* dict
* collections module
