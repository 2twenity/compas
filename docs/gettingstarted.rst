COMPAS is implemented entirely in Python such that it can be used in various programming
environments on different platforms and in combination with external software and libraries.
It is written for the default Python 3.x implementation (CPython),
but maintains backward compatibility with Python 2.7 such that it can be used
with the IronPython versions embedded in Rhino and Grasshopper.
